### Hi there ğŸ‘‹

**taydeo/taydeo** is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

Here are some ideas to get you started:

- ğŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently the Technology Lead at OCHA RPG!
- ğŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning C++, server infrastructure, and AWS tools
- ğŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on anything really!
- ğŸ’¬ Ask me about anything Spigot or Java related
- ğŸ“« How to reach me: tadeo@ocha-rpg.net, tadeo#8262
- âš¡ Fun fact: Cats to me are the greatest thing to exist (apart from Minecraft)!
